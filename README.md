# RAG-CHATBOT
 Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines the strengths of pre-trained language models and information retrieval systems to generate responses in a conversational AI system or to create content by leveraging external knowledge. It integrates the retrieval of relevant information from a knowledge source and the generation of responses based on that retrieved information.

 In a typical RAG setup:

**Retrieval**: Given a user query or prompt, the system searches through a knowledge source (a vector store with text embeddings) to find relevant documents or text snippets. The retrieval component typically employs some form of similarity or relevance scoring to determine which portions of the knowledge source are most pertinent to the input query.

**Generation**: The retrieved documents or snippets are then provided to a large language model, which uses them as additional context for generating a more detailed, factual, and relevant response.

 **STEPS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RAG MODEL**


**Load documents**: LangChain provides multiple built-in document loaders, that work with PDF files, JSON files, or a Python file in your file directory.  We can use LangChain’s PyPDFLoader to import your PDF seamlessly.

**Split documents into chunks**: When our document is long, it’s necessary to split up our document text into chunks. There are various ways to split your text. Let’s just use the simplest method CharacterTextSplitter to split based on characters and measure chunk length by the number of characters. 
**Create text embeddings**: The text chunks are then translated into numerical vectors through embeddings, allowing us to work with text data like semantic search in a computationally efficient manner. We can choose an embedding model provider like OpenAI for this task.

**Create a vector store**: We then need to store our embedding vectors in a vector store, which allows us to search and retrieve the relevant vectors at query time. 

**Create a retriever interface**: We can expose the vector store in a retriever interface. To retrieve text, we can choose a search type like “similarity” to use similarity search in the retriever object where it selects text chunk vectors that are most similar to the question vector.
